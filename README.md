## Overview  
The **Loan Approval System** is a machine learning-based application that predicts the risk flag for loan approvals. The system provides two approaches for prediction:  

1. **Traditional Machine Learning Models** â€“ A modular coding approach using standard ML algorithms.  
2. **PyCaret Automation** â€“ A low-code ML automation tool allowing users to select the prediction method.  

The system also features **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, a **dashboard**, and an **interactive Flask-based website** for visualization and evaluation.  

## Features  
- **Multiple Prediction Methods**  
  - Users can choose between traditional ML models and PyCaret for prediction.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Provides insights into the dataset before making predictions.  
- **Flask Web Application**  
  - A user-friendly interface to interact with the system.  
- **PyCaret Model Evaluation**  
  - Displays evaluation metrics such as **F1-score, recall, and precision** when clicked.  
- **Model Performance Comparison**  
  - Graphs comparing different models' performances.  
- **Interactive Evaluation**  
  - Clickable buttons to view detailed evaluation metrics for each model.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Flask** (Web Framework)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Traditional ML Models)  
- **PyCaret** (Automated ML)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** (Visualization)
